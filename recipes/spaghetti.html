        Description
    </h3>
    <p>
        I was shown this recipe—Camp David spaghetti with Italian sausage—by a Navy chef who served it to presidents at Camp David, MD.
        I have served it to my family many times, and it is certainly fit for a president. It is best with a garden salad and crusty garlic bread.
